For the past couple years, a couple friends and I designed and play our own fantasy tennis game for each of the 4 major tournaments. My friend, Santay, would keep score by manually entering stats into an excel spreadsheet. This repo contains the code for a website that scrapes data from atpworldtour.com in order to calculate scores. A local version of the website can be started by running updating tInfo.txt and then running:

python players.py
python run.py
